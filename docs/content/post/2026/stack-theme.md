title: Switching to "stack" theme.

The paper theme is a bit blank, and I also don't like their look on mobile. So I started looking around and I found [Stack](https://stack.jimmycai.com/).

It has enough configuration to keep me busy for a while, but on first look, it's not as complicated as some of the more crazy ones out there.

So how do I look?
