The inputs are rather straightforward but do let me know if anything can be improved.\nBuild and Deploy The app is written as a single React app, and deployed as a static site on Github Pages. The build and deployment is automated through Github Action.\n","date":"2026-01-18T22:33:23Z","image":"/p/wealth-simulator/cover.png","permalink":"/p/wealth-simulator/","title":"Wealth Simulator"},{"content":"This repository was created three years ago. Three years, and I finally gotten around to actually build the website out of it :D\nSetup overview The site is generated using Hugo. The Hugo content is stored under /docs folder. Each commit to main branch triggers a github action to build and push the page.\nThe Github action YAML is straightforward enough. The most tricky line is perharp the publish_dir: ./docs/public. This copy the content of the right place where Hugo built the site. Took me 4-5 tries to figured that out (reading the build output was very helpful!)\nHugo configuration Hugo out of the box uses TOML (though it can also support YAML and JSON). These days, my editor of choice is VS code. And it\u0026rsquo;s a bit mind-blowing to discover that VS code out of the box does not support TOML.\nI have written too much YAML (and hated every minute of it), but the alternative is to install and 3rd party plugin for TOML support - which, as of right now, is this one.
